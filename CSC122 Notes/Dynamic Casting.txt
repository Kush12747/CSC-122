* check if the actual object pointed to is of the type we
 * are testing for.  If it is, the address will be returned
 * in the guise of the properly typed pointer.  We can store
 * this and use it to call functions more specific to the
 * new type.
 *
 * In fact, 'is' here is quite general.  To the compiler, a
 * pointer is of the correct type if the true type is any
 * descendant of the requested type.  So when we store the
 * new pointer, we can narrow our knowledge further and use
 * a more limited language shared in a sub-tree of our
 * hierarchy!
